# Project goals:
### 1. Implementing DynamicArray, 1 and 2 way LinkedList classes derived from PriorityQueue interface and methods for:
- Enqueueing an element
- Dequeueing an element
- Peeking at next element to dequeue
- Getting the size of the queue
- Modifiying an element's priority

### 2. Experimental determination of time complexities of mentioned operations in best, average and worst cases.
### 3. Comparison of the complexities of operations between each data structure.
