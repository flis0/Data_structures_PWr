### Project goals:
##### 1. Implementing LinkedList and DynamicArray classes and methods for:
- adding an element at the front
- adding an element at the back
- removing an element from the front
- removing an element from the back
- inserting an element at given index
- erasing an element from given index
- finding a index of an element with given value

##### 2. Experimental determination of time complexities of mentioned operations.
##### 3. Comparison of the complexities of each operation between each data structure.
